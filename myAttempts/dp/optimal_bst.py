#Description
"""
Given some keys [1,2,...,n] and the keys' search probabilities = [p1, p2, ..., Pn]
Now return the most optimal Binary Search Tree (BST) such that the average cost to query the nodes 
in the tree is minimized.

Assume that the query node is always in the tree. So no failed queries.

NOTE: This was the third problem discussed in the DP part of Tim's algo-2 course
